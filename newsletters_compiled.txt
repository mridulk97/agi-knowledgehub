TITLE: THE BRIEFING


The Briefing
By Martin Peers


Greetings!


This year is really turning into a dud for tech stocks. ’s big
market sell-off slammed the tech sector across the board,
particularly chip companies like Nvidia and Broadcom that have
wide exposure to China. That made it a somewhat inauspicious
day for CoreWeave, a young cloud company operating data centers
for artificial intelligence firms, to release paperwork for its
planned public debut.


CoreWeave’s IPO is much anticipated, as it will give investors
another avenue for exposure to AI. And on some metrics,
CoreWeave looks to be going gangbusters. As my colleague Cory
Weinberg scooped on Sunday, the IPO filing showed that
CoreWeave’s revenue skyrocketed by eight times to $1.9 billion.
The only fly in the ointment is that Microsoft accounted for 62% of
that revenue, a concentration of risk that surely won’t thrill

investors. After all, Microsoft is a competitor as well as a customer
of CoreWeave (as we described here). A shortage of AI data center
capacity makes CoreWeave valuable for Microsoft right now—but
given how many data centers are under development, that may not
always be the case. It also may not help that the founders have
cashed out nearly $500 million worth of stock already, as Cory
reported tonight.


Whatever investors make of the company, its IPO prospects likely
rest in part on the state of the market. ’s drop—the S&P
500 fell 1.7%—appeared driven by investors realizing that
President Donald Trump’s threats of additional tariffs against
China and new levies on Canada and Mexico are likely to become a
reality as of .


Of the group of tech companies with at least a trillion-dollar
market capitalization, only Meta Platforms is up for the year. The
rest are down anywhere from about 5% (for Apple) to roughly 30%


for Tesla (which as a result no longer can be counted as a trillion-
dollar company), according to Koyfin data. Some of these stocks


are coming off a good year in 2024, which likely mutes the pain of
the sell-off. Nvidia, for instance, was up 171% last year and 239%
in 2023, which puts its 15% year-to-date decline into perspective.


But for a couple—Microsoft and to a lesser extent Alphabet—last
year wasn’t that great either. Take Microsoft, whose partnership
with OpenAI made it an early entrant in the AI revolution of the
past two years. Since the start of last year, Microsoft stock has

risen just 6%. Alphabet is doing a little better: It has gained about
21% since the start of last year. Still, that pales compared with
Meta’s 90% gain in the same period.


Given the widespread economic uncertainty sparked by Trump’s
continual tariff threats, the market jitters are likely to be a
permanent feature of this year. The pain is extending to crypto, a
sector that should be roaring right now given Trump’s
deregulation moves. But the negative impact of his tariffs can
offset the positive impact of his other moves, as we saw
, when a bitcoin sell-off wiped out most of the gains
sparked earlier by his announcement about the specific
cryptocurrencies he’d add to the crypto “strategic reserve” he
wants to create. Coinbase dropped nearly 5% and is off 17%
for the year.


It’s still early days, but it doesn’t look like we’re going to see a
repeat of the robust market rally that accompanied the first Trump
administration.


As for TikTok...


Meanwhile, amid Trump’s tough tariff talk, the clock is ticking on
TikTok. When he took office in January, Trump put a ban of the
app on hold, giving TikTok 75 more days to get into compliance
with a law that requires it to cut ties with its Chinese parent
ByteDance or face a U.S. ban. That 75-day period runs out .

https://mail.superhuman.com/muditg@stanford.edu/inbox/newsletters/thread/1955eb0afe70bf51 3/8


In the days after Trump delayed the bill, he talked a lot about all
the interest from U.S. companies in buying into TikTok.
Anticipation about a deal coming soon intensified after Trump
said on Jan. 25 he’d make a decision on the app’s future in 30
days. But time has passed, and all the chatter about TikTok has
gone quiet.


One reason may be that Trump’s tariff threats against China,
which almost certainly will tie into the TikTok negotiation, have
only gotten worse. Judging from this New York Times story on
Monday, the Chinese are not moving quickly enough for Trump’s
liking, because they’re busy trying to figure out what the president
wants. As the Chinese government will have to agree to any deal
on TikTok, talks might be up in the air until the broader tariffs
discussion gets underway.


TikTok fans likely have little to worry about. Trump could delay
the law’s implementation again if he needs to. It’s possible some
supporters of the law will start to complain, but there’s little they
can do other than sue. And fighting Trump in court won’t be a
speedy process.

In the early days of computing, the vision for how humans would interact
with computers looked nothing like the paradigm we've known for the past
50 years. One of the founding documents of computing was Alan Turingʼs
“Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” In it, Turing didnʼt describe the
point-and-click paradigm we have .
Instead, the earliest visions of computing machines were framed as
reasoning agents, responding dynamically to human input. When John
McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon coined
the term “artificial intelligence” in a 1955 research proposal, they described
machines that, rather than relying on step-by-step human prompting, could
autonomously perform tasks, learn, and even reason like a human.
That vision never materialized, due to a combination of hardware
constraints, especially insufficient processing power, as well as slow
progress in AI through the 1980s and 1990s, and the commercial success
of the graphical user interface (GUI). People settled for a direct
manipulation paradigm, where users manually interact with graphical
interfaces via mouse and keyboard.
Even in these simpler forms, Steve Jobs described computers as “a bicycle
of the mind... something that takes us far beyond our inherent abilities.” But
the vision for a computer wasnʼt meant to be a tool you handle, like a pencil.
It was meant to automate away aspects of work that humans donʼt need to
do.
Whatʼs old is becoming new. Increasingly, computing is returning to the
original vision of its founding days — autonomous reasoning machines that
can perform tasks independent of direct human manipulation. McKinsey
estimates $4.4 trillion of annual economic value creation globally due to AI,

largely driven by AI agents. Andrew Ng has described agentic AI as “the
most important trend to pay attention to” in November 2024.
The introduction of agents in almost every use case is expected to be the
primary driver of value as AI is increasingly deployed, and it is expected to
increase in volume by 45% over the next five years. More agents,
everywhere. 2025 is expected to be the year of the AI agent. The number of
enterprise applications with agentic AI is projected to increase to 33% by
2028, up from 1% .
Thatʼs where Replit comes in. Replit is pushing forward the usefulness of AI
agents in one key category — software creation.
Since the companyʼs beginning, Replitʼs mission has been to democratize
access to programming and empowering a billion software creators. Amjad
Masad, the CEO of Replit, believes that AI is the unlock to that
democratization. As he describes it, “if you can use a computer you should
be able to make software.”
The Replit Agent is a code generation agent meant to automatically produce
an application from an idea expressed in natural language. By removing the
barrier of becoming a professional software engineer, Replit can enable the
fruition of the original vision of computing — autonomously generated
software applications that can perform specific tasks.

vision of computing a reality with agentic AI, check out our new memo on

Some takeaways:
1. Don’t be afraid to start over: Notion’s early years were extremely
challenging. Ivan and his co-founder made the drastic decision to scrap
everything, fire their small team, and rebuild from scratch. This bold
pivot (including a move to Kyoto to code 18 hours a day) was risky but
ultimately turned Notion into the product that fit the market.
2. Build a great product above all else: Rather than spending energy on
early publicity or fundraising, focus on making something people truly
love. “If you build something great, the network will come and investors
will say yes,” Ivan explains, highlighting that Notion’s team devoted
themselves to product over hype in the early days.
3. Notion’s first version flopped—it was buggy and too complex.
4. Build for the user, not just yourself—Ivan admits the original product
was “what I wanted” rather than what users actually needed. The
reboot succeeded because they incorporated user feedback and
simplified the experience. Lesson: Solve real user problems, and be
willing to rethink your assumptions.
5. Community is a competitive advantage: Notion cultivated a passionate
community as its not-so-secret weapon. Early on, Ivan personally
replied to users’ tweets and emails, showing there’s a human behind the
product. By empowering power users (through programs like Notion
Ambassadors and community events), Notion created an army of
evangelists who spread the word and even built local communities
around the world.
6. Stay true to your vision (but stay flexible): Even as Notion struggled,
Ivan’s core vision never changed: “to give anyone the ability to
customize so


ware to their needs.” They drew inspiration from early
computer pioneers and stuck to the mission of an all-in-one tool. But
they stayed flexible on implementation, completely overhauling the
tech and UX when it wasn’t working. Key insight: Hold your vision, but
pivot on tactics when needed.
7. Ivan admits their first product was too confusing: “People don’t want to
build apps.” The big lesson was to solve a real user need. Notion’s team

pivoted to a more familiar concept (notes and docs with a twist),


essentially “building for the world, not just for ourselves.” This product-
market-fit insight—make it simple, then gradually introduce advanced


features—was the game changer that set Notion on a growth
trajectory.
8. Ivan’s advice for entrepreneurs struggling with direction: “Reset and
start again if you need to.” He believes that progress o


en comes from


be
er abstractions and learning from past mistakes.
9. Stay lean to move fast. Notion intentionally kept its team small and
scrappy. Remarkably, they hit unicorn status with just a few dozen


employees. This lean-team approach meant faster decisions, a tight-
knit culture, and the ability to iterate quickly without heavy process.


10. Notion took an unconventional path of delaying monetization on
certain features and offering generous free plans early on. This wasn’t
because they didn’t care about revenue but because they cared more


about building trust and providing value to users. By not nickel-and-
diming their community and only charging when the product truly


delivered enough value, Notion created goodwill that translated into
loyalty and word of mouth. The result? When they did start monetizing
team plans and upsells, users were more than willing to pay, and many
had already become advocates.
11. When building horizontal products:
a. Start with a clear, compelling use case that gives you broad
distribution (like docs/notes)
b. Hide your broader vision inside something people already
understand and want
c. Balance between “Lego bricks” (foundational capabilities) and
“Lego boxes” (packaged solutions)
d. Recognize that different segments need different levels of
assembly and guidance
